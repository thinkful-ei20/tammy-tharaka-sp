#Cards to Get Woke.
Revisit America's unsung heros through a deck of cards.

This is stuff you won't find in history books, the forgotten struggles and unifiying strength brought to America by minorities, immigrants, and their supporters. 

Get woke.

This app uses an alorithm to emulate [spaced repetition](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/23/spaced-repetition-a-hack-to-make-your-brain-store-information). 

This deck of cards cycles through images of a individuals who shaped American discourse on civil rights within the States and abroad. 

The purpose is to highlight how outsiders continuously shaped American ideals and how these ideas influence the world.
